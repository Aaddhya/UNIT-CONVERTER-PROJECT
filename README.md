Unit Converter Application (Python)

● Overview of the Project
The Unit Converter Application is a simple and efficient Python-based tool designed to convert values between commonly used measurement units. It helps users quickly convert units related to length, weight, and temperature without performing manual calculations.
The project focuses on demonstrating fundamental Python concepts such as functions, conditionals, loops, and input validation. It serves as a beginner-friendly real-world project that is lightweight, accurate, and easy to use.

● Features
1. Convert between different unit categories:
•	Length: meters ↔ kilometers ↔ centimeters ↔ miles
•	Weight: grams ↔ kilograms ↔ pounds
•	Temperature: Celsius ↔ Fahrenheit ↔ Kelvin
2. User-friendly console interface
3. Accurate conversions using standard formulas
4.Input validation to avoid errors
5. Supports continuous usage (loop until user exits)
6. Modular code structure for easy maintenance

● Technologies / Tools Used
•	Programming Language: Python 3
•	Tools:
o	Python IDLE / VS Code / PyCharm (optional)
o	Command Line / Terminal to run the script
•	Libraries:
o	Only Python standard libraries (no external dependencies)

● Steps to Install & Run the Project
1. Install Python
Download and install Python 3 from:
https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. Download the Project File
Save the Python script (unit_converter.py).
3. Open Terminal / Command Prompt
Navigate to the folder where the script is saved.
4. Run the Program
Type:
python unit_converter.py
5. Follow On-screen Instructions
Choose a category → Enter value → Get the converted output.

● Instructions for Testing
To test the application:
1. Functional Testing
•	Check length conversion (example: 1000 m → 1 km)
•	Check weight conversion (example: 1 kg → 1000 g)
•	Check temperature conversion (example: 0°C → 32°F)
2. Input Validation Testing
•	Enter alphabets instead of numbers → Should show an error message
•	Enter negative values for invalid conversions (optional)
3. Interface Testing
•	Menu displays correctly
•	Loop runs until "Exit" is selected
